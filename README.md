# TCGLiveUtils
Extracts data from Pokémon TCG Live's files downloaded in your machine and formats the content into json or mediawiki-based tables.

## Setup

1. Install Python if you don't have it already

2. Copy the `config-cache` and `localization-cache` folders from `%localappdata%low\pokemon\Pokemon TCG Live` into this directory

3. Running their scripts into a terminal such as `python .\tcgliveladder.py` will create a default generated file

## Todo
- Typings
- Include card data utils
- Save outputs in a centralized folder
- Fix localization for specific langs
